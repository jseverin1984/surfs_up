# Surfs Up Surf and Ice Cream Shop

## Overview

I was tasked with analyzing the last 8 years worth of weather data in order to help W. Avey in his decision to open up a new
surf shop on the islands of Hawaii.  I used sqlAlchemy to access the squlite database and create dataframes of the data needed. Lastly,
I ran a quick statistical analysis on said data in order give a better understanding on the historical weather data and provide W. Avey
with the best information possible to help him make a decision about opening a new business.

## Results

Below I have highlited "three" key differnces in weather between the June and December data. The two images provided, show the statistical
summaries for both June and December.
